# RNA-seq Pipeline Analysis on Seven Bridges

## Project Overview
This repository documents the process of running an RNA-seq processing pipeline on the Seven Bridges platform using RNA-seq data from the Personal Genome Project (PGP) UK. The analysis involved five patients' data, processed to identify gene expression differences.

## Process
- Metadata was reviewed and corrected for errors.
- RNA-seq data for each of the five patients was processed in a batch job, resulting in multiple output files per patient.

## Repository Contents
- `Aizhan_Uteubayeva_RNAseq_HW_summary.docx`: A Word document detailing the step-by-step process followed, including screenshots of the pipeline execution and metadata correction.

## How to Navigate
- The document outlines each step taken to set up and run the RNA-seq pipeline, including the correction of specific metadata errors and the organization of output files.

## How to Use
- The document can be viewed to understand the RNA-seq processing steps on the Seven Bridges platform and can serve as a guide for similar future analyses.
